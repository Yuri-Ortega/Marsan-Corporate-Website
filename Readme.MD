# 🚗Marsan Motors

Marsan Motors is a Filipino car brand simple website concept that I developed not just practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skill, but as a unique idea that aims to look like a real and professional car brand.

This project was inspired by big car companies that have their own official car brand websites. Because of this, I thought of creating my own car brand website to have uniqueness, creativity, and to imagine what it would be like to have my own Filipino-made car brand that can compete with international brands.
